  Recurring payments on the blockchain have been a topic of discussion for some time. First introduced in [EIP-1337](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1337) in 2018, the proposal never really caught on. My approach to recurring payments on Ethereum takes a simpler approach than EIP-1337 did, which may help it have a larger impact on the community.
